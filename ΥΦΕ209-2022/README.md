## Description
### For the course of Quantum Information and Processing we had to replicate certain figures (FIG. 1, 2 and 5) from the paper Phys. Rev. D 90, 044046 (2015) "Stability bounds on compact astrophysical objects from information-entropic measure". 
### We calculated the Configurational Entropy of cold white dwarfs. Firstly, we solved the Lane-Emden equation and then we calculated the normalized modal fraction $f(|k|)$ for sample values of the polytropic index γ.
### Next, we calculated the configurational entropy and mass of the white dwarfs for several values of the polytropic index γ. 
### Finally, we calculated the quantity $Sa^3$ for several values of the polytropic index γ.
## Figure 1
### Normalized modal fraction $f(|k|)$ for sample values of the polytropic index γ.
## Figure 2
### Configurational entropy (continuous line) and mass (dotted line) versus polytropic index γ.
## Figure 3
### Configurational entropy versus polytropic index γ for polytropes. We display results for several choices of cutoff for kmin.
